# Why I started this blog

Hey there, fellow reader.

I go by Kazyel on the internet. I'm a 23-year-old web developer based in Brazil. I work with TypeScript, React, Node.js, Golang and a few other technologies.

Since this is my first post, I don't expect to have the ability to write something very interesting, elaborate, or even useful yet. Especially since I'm not an expert in the field and have never had experience writing, and actually, I never liked writing about things or about myself.

However, I don't know if it's an age thing or what, but I wanted to start writing about programming and my life, and everyone starts somewhere, right?

Anyway, as the title suggests, I just want to talk a bit about what sparked this motivation in me and what ended up leading me to create this blog.

## Feeling Incompetent

Certainly, the vast majority of people who start programming feel incompetent at some point in their lives, and I'm no exception. And for me, I think I handle it well. I know it's a normal feeling that requires a continuous process of learning (and resilience).

But I don't know what's gotten into me lately, because for a while now, this feeling has been bothering me more than usual. And that's where the first motivation comes in: **I simply want to improve and go further**.

I know the best way to improve is by practicing, and that writing helps to consolidate knowledge and develop critical thinking. So, I want to write about what I learn, what I do, and what I think or feel.

## Documenting My Journey

Just to clarify here, at the time I'm writing this post, I'm in my second year as a professional web developer, attending college and still trying to make a name for myself in the market and as a developer.

And since I know I have a lot to learn, not only technically but also as a professional and as a person, I think it would be very interesting and fun to document my journey.

And who knows, maybe in the future I can look back and see how much I've evolved, and also help other people who are going through the same things I am and who somehow happen to be reading this.

## Sharing Things

I'm not one of the most sociable people, I don't have many friends who are developers yet, and I'm definitely not cut out for social media, so I don't have many opportunities to share what I learn or what I do. In fact, I need to immediately improve my networking!

But for now, whether it's a piece of code, a tip, a rant, or an opinion, I intend to share and save all of it here. Initially, for myself, but if anyone else is interested and finds it useful, I'd be happy about that.

## Achieving Consistency

**I probably have undiagnosed ADHD.**

My girlfriend is studying psychology and has already talked to me about it, and I know that one of my biggest difficulties is consistency and attention, so maybe it is true. At the moment, I can't afford to get an evaluation, but as soon as possible, I plan to.

I start many things but can't finish them or keep up the pace, which is obviously a problem, especially when it comes to something that requires practice and discipline, like programming.

To work around this, I want to establish a writing routine and commit to publishing regularly. And to generate content, I'll have to practice, read, and study, so I think everything will fit together very well!

Even if they're simple posts, the important thing is to maintain consistency and improve little by little.

## Conclusion

Well, I think that's it. I believe I managed to convey everything I was feeling and minimally present who I am.

Writing was better than I expected, to be honest, I can definitely see myself writing more often.

I hope it was at least somewhat interesting to read. I plan to keep this more casual and personal vibe here. I want this to be a space where I can be myself and share my ideas and experiences.
